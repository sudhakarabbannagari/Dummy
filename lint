2. Install Playwright

You can install Playwright using npm. There are two options:

Option 1: Install Playwright as a dev dependency (recommended)

npm install -D @playwright/test


-D means it will be installed as a dev dependency (only needed during development/testing).

@playwright/test is the official Playwright testing library.

3. Install the browsers

After installing Playwright, you need to install the browsers it will use for testing:

npx playwright install


This will download Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit by default.

4. Optional: Initialize Playwright config

You can generate a default configuration file for Playwright in your project:

npx playwright init


This will:

Create playwright.config.ts

Set up example tests

Optionally create a test directory (usually tests/)

5. Create a test

Inside your Angular project, you can create a folder for tests, for example e2e/:

mkdir e2e


Then create a sample test, e.g., example.spec.ts:

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:4200');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Angular App/);
});
