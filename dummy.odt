# AWS Resilience Testing

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the strategy, processes, tools, and governance for resilience testing on AWS. The goal is to validate that systems can **withstand, adapt to, and recover from failures** while continuing to meet business and customer expectations.

Resilience testing ensures:

* High availability and fault tolerance
* Controlled failure recovery
* Compliance with RTO/RPO objectives
* Confidence during real-world incidents

---

## 2. Scope

This document applies to:

* All production and pre-production AWS workloads
* Microservices, monoliths, and serverless architectures
* Infrastructure, application, data, and operational layers

Included services:

* EC2, Auto Scaling, ELB/ALB/NLB
* ECS, EKS, Lambda
* RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, S3
* Route 53, CloudFront
* IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager

---

## 3. Key Resilience Concepts

### 3.1 High Availability (HA)

Designing systems to remain operational during failures by using:

* Multi-AZ deployments
* Redundant components
* Load balancing

### 3.2 Fault Tolerance

Ability to continue operating when components fail without manual intervention.

### 3.3 Disaster Recovery (DR)

Ability to recover from catastrophic failures such as region loss.

### 3.4 Chaos Engineering

Intentional injection of failures to validate resilience assumptions.

---

## 4. Resilience Objectives

### 4.1 Availability Targets

| Tier              | Availability |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Tier 0 (Critical) | 99.99%       |
| Tier 1            | 99.9%        |
| Tier 2            | 99.5%        |

### 4.2 Recovery Objectives

* **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime
* **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss

---

## 5. AWS Well-Architected Framework Alignment

This testing strategy aligns with the **Reliability Pillar**:

* Foundations
* Workload architecture
* Change management
* Failure management

---

## 6. Resilience Testing Types

### 6.1 Infrastructure Failure Testing

Validates resilience against infrastructure-level failures.

Examples:

* EC2 instance termination
* AZ outage simulation
* Auto Scaling failure

### 6.2 Application Failure Testing

Validates application behavior under stress or failure.

Examples:

* Application process crashes
* Dependency timeouts
* Circuit breaker validation

### 6.3 Network Failure Testing

Validates system behavior during network issues.

Examples:

* Security Group rule changes
* Route table misconfigurations
* DNS resolution failures

### 6.4 Data Layer Failure Testing

Validates database and storage resilience.

Examples:

* RDS failover
* DynamoDB throttling
* S3 access denial

### 6.5 Region and AZ Failure Testing

Validates large-scale disaster recovery.

Examples:

* Primary region isolation
* Cross-region failover

---

## 7. Testing Environments

| Environment       | Purpose                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Sandbox           | Early experimentation    |
| Non-Prod          | Planned resilience tests |
| Prod (Controlled) | GameDays and Chaos tests |

**Note:** Production testing requires executive approval and rollback plans.

---

## 8. Testing Tools and Services

### 8.1 AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS)

Used to simulate failures such as:

* Instance termination
* CPU/memory stress
* Network latency

### 8.2 Chaos Engineering Tools

* AWS FIS
* Chaos Monkey (EC2/EKS)
* LitmusChaos (Kubernetes)

### 8.3 Monitoring and Observability

* Amazon CloudWatch
* AWS X-Ray
* CloudTrail
* OpenTelemetry

---

## 9. Test Scenarios

### 9.1 EC2 Instance Failure

**Objective:** Validate Auto Scaling recovery

Steps:

1. Terminate EC2 instance via FIS
2. Observe ASG replacement
3. Verify load balancer health

Success Criteria:

* No customer-visible outage
* Instance replaced within SLA

---

### 9.2 AZ Failure Simulation

**Objective:** Validate Multi-AZ resilience

Steps:

1. Block traffic to one AZ
2. Observe traffic redistribution

Success Criteria:

* Services remain operational
* Error rate < threshold

---

### 9.3 Database Failover

**Objective:** Validate RDS/Aurora failover

Steps:

1. Trigger forced failover
2. Monitor application behavior

Success Criteria:

* Failover < RTO
* No data corruption

## 13. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility    |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Cloud Architect | Resilience design |
| SRE             | Test execution    |
| Dev Team        | Application fixes |
